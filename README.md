The main goal of this app is to improve the transparency of work flow of the company.
For example CEO create own account and accounts of department heads. Department head 
should every day open the app and constantly update what doing his department today. 
Once the department make a step immediately reported. These reports is the "How You Doin". 
The short regular messages from group to one person. 
The main thing is that it can be implemented in the company as a tree. From CEO to simple
employee.
The TOP of the branch should pull down list to refresh. Can choose employee to see all his
reports from list of the last reports or from his list of ymploees.
